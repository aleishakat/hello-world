Documentation Guidelines

At a minumum, please adhere to these guidelines when documenting your code, creating guides and writing best practices:

Write simple sentences, using the present tense and proper punctuation. 
Acronyms should always include a fully spelled out version at first referece. E.g., "WFO (Workforce Optimization)"
Use tags that increase searchability.
